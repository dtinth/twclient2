twclient2 - thaiWitter Client Extension
=======================================

This extension adds the following capability to [thaiWitter](http://tw.dt.in.th/) when running on Firefox.

* __Direct API Calls__: the client will connect to Twitter by itself, and the server will just sign the request, so less bandwidth usage for my web hosting. :)
* __User Stream__: enable real-time stream, so you can see new tweets as one tweet it.
* __Popup Notifications__: display pop-up notifications when there is new tweet, or mention, depending on your settings.


How to Install
--------------

Right click and save this file to your desktop or temporary place: [__twclient.xpi__](https://github.com/dtinth/twclient2/blob/master/twclient2.xpi?raw=true).

And then, drag the downloaded file into the Firefox window, when prompted to install, install it. And that's it!
